# Simple Counter App

Hello and welcome to my counter app, this is a very simple proof of concept that I will do three times per week in many languages just to showcase basic coding skills for the sake of building a rapport and also to improve my general knowledge.

### https://cukonroberto.github.io/counter-app/

This project has a public github pages link as well.

This uses [MUI](https://mui.com/) as the component library.
